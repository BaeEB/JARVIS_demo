The provided code has several potential issues indicated by the cppcheck rules. To address these, we need to ensure we don't have redundant or identical conditions, unnecessary null pointer checks, and that variables are not left unread (unused).

Looking at the code, the violation "identicalConditionAfterEarlyExit" can be identified where the same condition is being checked twice, once after a check for `NULL` parameters and then again combined with other conditions. Also, an example of the violation "unreadVariable" may be inferred, where the `always_seeds` variable is assigned but might not be used if `info->always_seeds` remains `NULL`.

Let's fix these issues based on the standard approach described in the violation information. The example code for correct handling of these violations is not included, so I'll fix it based on general coding best practices.

Here's the revised code:
```cpp
static theft_run_res theft_run_internal(struct theft *t, struct theft_propfun_info *info,
                int trials, theft_progress_cb *cb, void *env,
                struct theft_trial_report *r) {

    struct theft_trial_report fake_report;
    if (r == NULL) { r = &fake_report; }
    memset(r, 0, sizeof(*r));
    
    infer_arity(info);
    // Removed redundancy by deleting identical condition after early exit.
    if (t == NULL || info == NULL || info->fun == NULL) {
        return THEFT_RUN_ERROR_BAD_ARGS;
    }
    
    bool all_hashable = false;
    if (!check_all_args(info, &all_hashable)) {
        return THEFT_RUN_ERROR_MISSING_CALLBACK;
    }
    
    if (cb == NULL) { cb = default_progress_cb; }
    
    if (all_hashable) {
        if (t->requested_bloom_bits == 0) {
            t->requested_bloom_bits = theft_bloom_recommendation(trials);
        }
        if (t->requested_bloom_bits != THEFT_BLOOM_DISABLE) {
            t->bloom = theft_bloom_init(t->requested_bloom_bits);
        }
    }
    
    theft_seed seed = t->seed;
    theft_seed initial_seed = t->seed;
    // Moved the assignment inside the conditional block to avoid unread variable.
    int always_seeds = 0;
    if (info->always_seeds != NULL) {
        always_seeds = info->always_seed_count;
    }

    void *args[THEFT_MAX_ARITY];
    
    theft_progress_callback_res cres = THEFT_PROGRESS_CONTINUE;
    
    for (int trial = 0; trial < trials; trial++) {
        memset(args, 0xFF, sizeof(args));
        if (cres == THEFT_PROGRESS_HALT) { break; }
        
        if (trial < always_seeds) {
            seed = info->always_seeds[trial];
        } else if (trial == always_seeds) { // Removed redundant check (always_seeds > 0)
            seed = initial_seed;
        }
        
        struct theft_trial_info ti = {
            .name = info->name,
            .trial = trial,
            .seed = seed,
            .arity = info->arity,
            .args = args
        };
        
        theft_set_seed(t, seed);
        all_gen_res_t gres = gen_all_args(t, info, seed, args, env);
        switch (gres) {
            case ALL_GEN_SKIP:
                ti.status = THEFT_TRIAL_SKIP;
                r->skip++;
                cres = cb(&ti, env);
                break;
            case ALL_GEN_DUP:
                ti.status = THEFT_TRIAL_DUP;
                r->dup++;
                cres = cb(&ti, env);
                break;
            default:
            case ALL_GEN_ERROR:
                ti.status = THEFT_TRIAL_ERROR;
                cres = cb(&ti, env);
                return THEFT_RUN_ERROR;
            case ALL_GEN_OK:
                if (!run_trial(t, info, args, cb, env, r, &ti, &cres)) {
                    return THEFT_RUN_ERROR;
                }
        }
        
        free_args(info, args, env);
        
        theft_set_seed(t, seed);
        seed = theft_random(t);
    }
    
    if (r->fail > 0) {
        return THEFT_RUN_FAIL;
    } else {
        return THEFT_RUN_PASS;
    }
}
```

In this revised version, I have removed the redundant check for `info->arity`, ensured `always_seeds` is only assigned when `info->always_seeds` is not NULL, and removed the extraneous `always_seeds > 0` check since it's not needed after ensuring that the loop is exited early if `cres == THEFT_PROGRESS_HALT`. These changes maintain the original logic and functionality of the code while addressing the violations reported by cppcheck.
