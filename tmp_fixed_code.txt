From the information given, it seems that we have a derived class that is not calling the `__init__` method of its base class, which is a violation of the `W0231` rule according to Pylint. As per the recommendations of the rule, we should ensure that the `__init__` method of the base class is called from the derived class's `__init__` method.

The code to be fixed is incomplete, but with the information provided, I'm going to assume that this class inherits from a class named `Table` which has an `__init__` method that needs to be called. 

With this assumption, here is how you could correct the code:

```python
class TinyDB(Table):  # Placeholder for the actual base class name if it's not 'Table'
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        """
        Create a new instance of TinyDB.
        """
        # Call the __init__ of the base class 'Table'
        super(TinyDB, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        # Your initialization code follows
        storage = kwargs.pop('storage', self.default_storage_class)

        # Prepare the storage
        self._storage: Storage = storage(*args, **kwargs)
        self._opened = True
```

Note: In the above code, `super(TinyDB, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)` is the line that calls the base class (`Table`) `__init__` method. If you are using Python 3, you can simply call `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` without specifying the class name and self, like this:

```python
super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
```

This makes the code cleaner and is the preferred way in Python 3. Since the Python version wasn't specified, I'm including both ways. Use the one that is appropriate for the Python version you are using.
