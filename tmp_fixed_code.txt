Based on the information provided, it seems that there is a base class named `Table` that has an `__init__` method which is not being called in the derived class `TinyDB`. The derived class must call the `__init__` method of the base class to ensure proper initialization. Below is the revised version of the code incorporating the call to the base class `__init__` method.

```python
class TinyDB(Table):  # Assuming it derives from a class named 'Table'
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        """
        Create a new instance of TinyDB.
        """
        # Call the __init__ of the base class 'Table'
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        storage = kwargs.pop('storage', self.default_storage_class)

        # Prepare the storage
        self._storage: Storage = storage(*args, **kwargs)

        self._opened = True
```

Note that I've added the class definition for clarity and assumed it inherits from a class named `Table`. The call to `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` is inserted to satisfy the `W0231 - super-init-not-called` rule violation. With this change, the derived class `TinyDB` is compliant with the rule and correctly calls the `__init__` method of its base class.
