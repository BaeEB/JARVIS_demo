The code provided contains several issues that have been identified based on the cppcheck violation rules given. Here's the revised code that addresses the mentioned violations without changing the execution result of the original code:

```cpp
static theft_run_res
theft_run_internal(struct theft *t, struct theft_propfun_info *info,
        int trials, theft_progress_cb *cb, void *env,
        struct theft_trial_report *r) {

    struct theft_trial_report fake_report;
    if (r == NULL) { r = &fake_report; }
    memset(r, 0, sizeof(*r));
    
    infer_arity(info);
    if (info->arity == 0) {
        return THEFT_RUN_ERROR_BAD_ARGS;
    }

    // Removed redundant condition info->arity == 0
    if (t == NULL || info == NULL || info->fun == NULL) {
        return THEFT_RUN_ERROR_BAD_ARGS;
    }
    
    bool all_hashable = false;
    if (!check_all_args(info, &all_hashable)) {
        return THEFT_RUN_ERROR_MISSING_CALLBACK;
    }

    if (cb == NULL) { cb = default_progress_cb; }

    /* If all arguments are hashable, then attempt to use
     * a bloom filter to avoid redundant checking. */
    if (all_hashable) {
        if (t->requested_bloom_bits == 0) {
            t->requested_bloom_bits = theft_bloom_recommendation(trials);
        }
        if (t->requested_bloom_bits != THEFT_BLOOM_DISABLE) {
            t->bloom = theft_bloom_init(t->requested_bloom_bits);
        }
    }
    
    theft_seed seed = t->seed;
    int always_seeds = info->always_seeds ? info->always_seed_count : 0;

    void *args[THEFT_MAX_ARITY];

    theft_progress_callback_res cres = THEFT_PROGRESS_CONTINUE;

    for (int trial = 0; trial < trials; trial++) {
        memset(args, 0xFF, sizeof(args));
        if (cres == THEFT_PROGRESS_HALT) { break; }

        /* If any seeds to always run were specified, use those before
         * reverting to the specified starting seed. */
        if (trial < always_seeds) {
            seed = info->always_seeds[trial];
        } else if ((always_seeds > 0) && (trial == always_seeds)) {
            seed = t->seed; // Use the initial seed stored in the theft structure
        }

        struct theft_trial_info ti = {
            .name = info->name,
            .trial = trial,
            .seed = seed,
            .arity = info->arity,
            .args = args
        };

        theft_set_seed(t, seed);
        all_gen_res_t gres = gen_all_args(t, info, seed, args, env);
        switch (gres) {
        case ALL_GEN_SKIP:
            /* skip generating these args */
            ti.status = THEFT_TRIAL_SKIP;
            r->skip++;
            cres = cb(&ti, env);
            break;
        case ALL_GEN_DUP:
            /* skip these args -- probably already tried */
            ti.status = THEFT_TRIAL_DUP;
            r->dup++;
            cres = cb(&ti, env);
            break;
        default:
        case ALL_GEN_ERROR:
            /* Error while generating args */
            ti.status = THEFT_TRIAL_ERROR;
            cres = cb(&ti, env);
            return THEFT_RUN_ERROR;
        case ALL_GEN_OK:
            /* (Extracted function to avoid deep nesting here.) */
            if (!run_trial(t, info, args, cb, env, r, &ti, &cres)) {
                return THEFT_RUN_ERROR;
            }
        }

        free_args(info, args, env);

        /* Restore last known seed and generate next. */
        theft_set_seed(t, seed);
        seed = theft_random(t);
    }

    if (r->fail > 0) {
        return THEFT_RUN_FAIL;
    } else {
        return THEFT_RUN_PASS;
    }
}
```

Let's break down the changes made:

1. Removed `|| info->arity == 0` from the conditional statement, as it was a redundant check (identicalConditionAfterEarlyExit). The arity is already checked right before this conditional, so if `info->arity` was `0`, the function would have returned with an error.
   
2. Adjusted `always_seeds` initialization to check whether `info->always_seeds` is `NULL` (nullPointerRedundantCheck). Removed the redundant line `if (info->always_seeds == NULL) { always_seeds = 0; }` and merged the null check with the initial assignment.

3. We did not find any violations related to unreadVariable within the provided code, so no changes have been made for this rule.

The given examples for each rule were left empty, which does not give additional context to the exact pattern to look for in these cases. However, the corrections made above are based on general practices aligned with the rule descriptions provided.
