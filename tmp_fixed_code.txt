The W0231 warning indicates that the `__init__` method of the base class 'Table' was not called in the derived class `TinyDB`. We need to ensure that the base class `__init__` method is called correctly to fix this issue without changing the execution results.

In the following code, I will assume that the class `TinyDB` inherits from `Table`, and call the `__init__` method of `Table` using `super().__init__()`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
class Table:
    # Assuming this is the base class with its own __init__ method
    def __init__(self):
        # Base class initialization logic here
        pass

class TinyDB(Table):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        """
        Create a new instance of TinyDB.
        """
        # Call the __init__ method of the base class 'Table'
        super().__init__()

        storage = kwargs.pop('storage', self.default_storage_class)

        # Prepare the storage
        self._storage: Storage = storage(*args, **kwargs)

        self._opened = True
```

Without seeing the full implementation of the base class 'Table' and the `TinyDB` class, I filled in the base class with a placeholder `__init__` method and a `pass` statement. The actual base class likely has its own initialization code.

Note: It is assumed that the base class name is 'Table', as indicated in the information about the rule violation. If the base class has a different name or additional initialization arguments, those should be used instead.

The corrected code now includes a call to the base class's `__init__` method at the beginning of the `TinyDB` class's `__init__` method, ensuring that the base class is properly initialized.
