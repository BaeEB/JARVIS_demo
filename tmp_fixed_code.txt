The provided code snippet is indicating that there is a derived class that has not called the `__init__` method of its base class. To comply with the pylint rule (W0231 - super-init-not-called), the derived class's `__init__` method should call the `__init__` method of the base class. Since the base class is noted as 'Table', the derived class's `__init__` method needs to include `super().__init__()` to properly initialize the base class part of the instance.

The information provided doesn't give the exact name of the derived class or whether it has any expected arguments for the base class `__init__`, so the example correction will assume no additional arguments are needed for the base class `__init__`.

Here's how you might correct the provided code:

```python
class DerivedFromTable(Table):  # Assuming the class name is DerivedFromTable and inherits from Table
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Create a new instance of TinyDB.
        """
        # First call the base class __init__ method
        super().__init__()  # Assuming no additional arguments for the base class __init__

        # Then proceed with the specific initializations of the derived class
        storage = kwargs.pop('storage', self.default_storage_class)

        # Prepare the storage
        self._storage: Storage = storage(*args, **kwargs)
        
        # Other initializations specific to this derived class
        self._opened = True
```

Without further information about the class hierarchy or the arguments for the base class, this is a generic way to resolve the W0231 violation. If the base class `__init__` requires specific arguments, those would need to be passed to `super().__init__(...)`. The context of the code is also important because there can be valid reasons for not calling the base class's `__init__`, but those are exceptions and typically would require disabling the pylint warning explicitly in the code.
