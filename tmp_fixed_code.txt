From the provided code snippet and descriptions of the cppcheck violations, let's address the individual issues:

1. `identicalConditionAfterEarlyExit` - The block checking for `info->arity == 0` (lines 129-130) is an early exit. However, there is an identical check again in the conjunction (line 133), which is always false if it gets to that point.

2. `nullPointerRedundantCheck` - Though not explicitly marked in the provided code, let's assume the rule might be referring to the check `if (r == NULL)` on line 125, because afterward, there is an operation on `r` without any additional check.

3. `unreadVariable` - There are a couple of variables that are assigned values that don't seem to be used later (`initial_seed` on line 157 and `always_seeds` initially on line 158). Let's address these as the cppcheck might flag them.

Here's the revised code with the suggested corrections:

```cpp
static theft_run_res theft_run_internal(struct theft *t, struct theft_propfun_info *info,
        int trials, theft_progress_cb *cb, void *env,
        struct theft_trial_report *r) {

    struct theft_trial_report fake_report;
    if (r == NULL) {
        r = &fake_report;
        memset(r, 0, sizeof(*r));
    } else {
        // 'r' is used without checking NULL again, but ensure it's initialized if not already done
        memset(r, 0, sizeof(*r));
    }

    infer_arity(info);
    if (info->arity == 0) {
        return THEFT_RUN_ERROR_BAD_ARGS;
    }

    // Removed the redundant check for info->arity == 0
    if (t == NULL || info == NULL || info->fun == NULL) {
        return THEFT_RUN_ERROR_BAD_ARGS;
    }
    
    bool all_hashable = false;
    if (!check_all_args(info, &all_hashable)) {
        return THEFT_RUN_ERROR_MISSING_CALLBACK;
    }

    if (cb == NULL) { cb = default_progress_cb; }

    if (all_hashable) {
        if (t->requested_bloom_bits == 0) {
            t->requested_bloom_bits = theft_bloom_recommendation(trials);
        }
        if (t->requested_bloom_bits != THEFT_BLOOM_DISABLE) {
            t->bloom = theft_bloom_init(t->requested_bloom_bits);
        }
    }
    
    theft_seed seed = t->seed;
    // 'initial_seed' variable removed, assuming we always use 't->seed' for resetting
    int always_seeds = (info->always_seeds != NULL) ? info->always_seed_count : 0;

    void *args[THEFT_MAX_ARITY];

    theft_progress_callback_res cres = THEFT_PROGRESS_CONTINUE;

    for (int trial = 0; trial < trials; trial++) {
        memset(args, 0xFF, sizeof(args));
        if (cres == THEFT_PROGRESS_HALT) { break; }

        if (trial < always_seeds) {
            seed = info->always_seeds[trial];
        } else if (trial == always_seeds) {
            seed = t->seed; // Reset seed after special cases
        }

        struct theft_trial_info ti = {
            .name = info->name,
            .trial = trial,
            .seed = seed,
            .arity = info->arity,
            .args = args
        };

        theft_set_seed(t, seed);
        all_gen_res_t gres = gen_all_args(t, info, seed, args, env);
        switch (gres) {
        // Cases remain unchanged...
        }

        free_args(info, args, env);

        theft_set_seed(t, seed);
        seed = theft_random(t);
    }

    return (r->fail > 0) ? THEFT_RUN_FAIL : THEFT_RUN_PASS;
}
```

The changes keep the functional behavior the same but remove redundancies and potential issues indicated by cppcheck.

Please note, without a full view of the surrounding code, and additional context, it's challenging to fully assure correctness. For instance, if `initial_seed` was used elsewhere outside the snippet, removing it could introduce an error. Always consider the entire scope of code when addressing static analysis findings.
