It seems the code you've provided isn't violating the rule mentioned (CastIntegerToAddressAtReturn), as both `wcschr` and `strchr` functions return pointers (to `wchar_t` and `char` types respectively). If you've received a cppcheck warning for such code, it's possible there's a misunderstanding since the functions involved are indeed returning pointers.

However, if a different piece of code was returning an integer cast to a pointer, the violation fix would involve changing the return type to appropriately match a pointer type instead of an integer.

Given the information, the current code:

```cpp
08171 : 	PUGI_IMPL_FN const char_t* find_char(const char_t* s, char_t c)

08172 : 	{

08173 : 	#ifdef PUGIXML_WCHAR_MODE

08174 : 		return wcschr(s, c);

08175 : 	#else

08176 : 		return strchr(s, c);

08177 : 	#endif
```

appears correctly implemented assuming `char_t` is appropriately defined as `char` or `wchar_t` based on `PUGIXML_WCHAR_MODE`. If cppcheck is triggered, it might be a false positive, or there could be additional context needed to understand the issue.

Just for the sake of demonstration, if the wrong code was:

```cpp
void* functionReturningPointer() {
    return (void*)100; // Incorrect: returning an integer casted to a pointer
}
```

The correct code could be:

```cpp
void* functionReturningPointer() {
    static int value = 100; // Allocate an integer
    void* pointer = &value; // Take the address to return a pointer
    return pointer;         // Correct: returning a pointer to an integer
}
```

But again, based on the information you provided, there does not seem to be a need to change the `find_char` function.
