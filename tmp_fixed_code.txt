It appears you've provided a code snippet that violates the `W0231` Pylint rule, which requires the `__init__` method of the base class to be called in the derived class's `__init__` method. However, you did not provide the base class 'Table' code. I will demonstrate how to correct this assuming that the base class 'Table' has an `__init__` method that needs to be called by the derived class 'TinyDB'. Below is how you can correct the code to adhere to the Pylint rule:

Before correction, the `__init__` method in the derived class 'TinyDB' doesn't call the `__init__` method of its base class 'Table'. 

The example of the correct code that calls the base class `__init__` is missing. However, I've filled out the revised code following the general practice of calling `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` to ensure the base class `__init__` gets called:

```python
class Table:
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Initialization code for Table
        pass

class TinyDB(Table):
    default_storage_class = None  # Assuming there's a default defined somewhere.

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        """
        Create a new instance of TinyDB.
        """

        # Call the __init__ of the base class Table.
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        storage = kwargs.pop('storage', self.default_storage_class)

        # Prepare the storage
        self._storage: Storage = storage(*args, **kwargs)

        self._opened = True
```

In this corrected version, the `__init__` method of 'TinyDB' now includes a call to the `__init__` method of its base class 'Table' using the `super()` function. This should satisfy the `W0231` Pylint rule.

Please note that `Table` is a placeholder for your actual base class and should be replaced with the actual class name. Additionally, if 'Table' `__init__` requires parameters, appropriate arguments should be passed to the `super().__init__` call.
