It seems that there has been some confusion in the instructions you provided. The "ConfigurationNotChecked" rule violation from CppCheck is not directly related to the code snippet you've given, as this rule typically deals with preprocessor conditions that haven't been addressed during static analysis.

However, from the code snippet provided, there doesn't appear to be an issue with configuration checking, but rather potential issues with the handling of dynamic memory (which is not related to the "ConfigurationNotChecked" rule). The code dynamically allocates memory for a buffer, uses it to format error strings, and then frees it. This could be problematic if exceptions are thrown or if there are multiple return paths from the function, leading to memory leaks. A better approach is to use an object that manages its own memory, such as `std::string` or `std::vector<char>`, but as per your request, the behavior of the code must not change. Since the code behavior is to remain the same, we should not modify the fundamental operation.

If we were to correct potential issues with the dynamic memory handling without changing the functionality, it could look like this (assuming this is the only focus):

```cpp
void XMLDocument::SetError(XMLError error, int lineNum, const char* format, ...)
{
    TIXMLASSERT(error >= 0 && error < XML_ERROR_COUNT);
    _errorID = error;
    _errorLineNum = lineNum;
    _errorStr.Reset();

    const size_t BUFFER_SIZE = 1000;
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

    TIXMLASSERT(sizeof(error) <= sizeof(int));
    TIXML_SNPRINTF(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, "Error=%s ErrorID=%d (0x%x) Line number=%d",
                   ErrorIDToName(error), int(error), int(error), lineNum);

    if (format) {
        size_t len = strlen(buffer);
        TIXML_SNPRINTF(buffer + len, BUFFER_SIZE - len, ": ");
        len = strlen(buffer);

        va_list va;
        va_start(va, format);
        TIXML_VSNPRINTF(buffer + len, BUFFER_SIZE - len, format, va);
        va_end(va);
    }
    _errorStr.SetStr(buffer);
}
```

The primary change in the corrected code is replacing the dynamic allocation (`char* buffer = new char[BUFFER_SIZE];`) with a stack allocation (`char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];`). This ensures that the memory is automatically freed when the function returns, thus preventing potential leaks.

Please be aware that the actual issue flagged by CppCheck regarding "ConfigurationNotChecked" is not addressed here, since no preprocessor directives or configurations are evident in the provided code snippet. If there is a specific configuration issue you need to address, you would typically need to provide additional context or code that includes preprocessor directives.
