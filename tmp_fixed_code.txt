To fix the W0231 pylint violation code, we need to ensure that the `__init__` method of the base class is properly called in the derived class. Based on the information you've provided, it seems like the base class here is `Table`, and the derived class `TinyDB` does not call the `Table`'s `__init__` method. 

Since you haven't provided the actual base class `Table` code or its `__init__` method, I will assume that it has an `__init__` method that doesn't require any arguments other than `self`. If it does require arguments, you will need to adjust the code to pass the appropriate ones.

Here's how the corrected code might look like:

```python
class Table:
    def __init__(self):
        # Assuming this is the body of Table's __init__ method
        pass

class TinyDB(Table):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        """
        Create a new instance of TinyDB.
        """
        # Call the __init__ method of the Table base class
        super().__init__()

        storage = kwargs.pop('storage', self.default_storage_class)

        # Prepare the storage
        self._storage: Storage = storage(*args, **kwargs)

        self._opened = True
```

Please note that super().__init__() is the line where the __init__ method from the base class `Table` is called. The actual `Table` class code is assumed for the purpose of this example. If the `Table` __init__ method requires arguments, you need to pass them accordingly when calling super().__init__(args).
